                I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri where there is a whole lot of no skiing. 
                However, my parents bought a condo that same year (2003) in Breckenridge, Colorado.
                For reference, it is the town in the background.
                With that, I had the opportunity to spend around a month a year there.
                By the age of 2, my dad had already stuck me on skis where I fell in love with the sport.
                The older I got, the more I enjoyed skiing and the better I got.
                Where it really peaked for me was during COVID, where my dad and I got to work/do school remotely from Breck.
                That was a peak season for me and just confirmed my want to be in Colorado as much as possible.
                Now I sutdy at the University in Denver where I get to ski as much as possible during the season.

This project was a lot of ups and downs. Having AI as support was nice, as I was able to make good progress throughout the project without getting stuck for too long. However, there were a lot of times AI would give too much code, to the point of not understanding what the code was doing. This caused me to have to cut down what was given to me which was frustrating as sometimes I would get rid of the wrong things. Although this was at first frustrating, it actually helped me understand my code a lot better toward the end of creating my project. With that, there were definitely some things I could refine as much as I would've liked given my lack of knowledge of html and the fact that this is my first ever project pertaining to html. I hope to come back to something like this when I'm better at html to see how much I have improved.
